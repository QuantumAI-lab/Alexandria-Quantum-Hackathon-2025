QAOA run evidence log
Backend: ibm_pittsburgh
Result status: OptimizationResultStatus.SUCCESS
Objective value: 192.6675

First iteration
--- Combination 1/10: Trip A patients = ['DT', 'GR', 'R2'] ---
Local problem size n_local=4 nodes -> expected qubits (binary vars) = 12
base_primitive._get_mode_service_backend:WARNING:2025-09-11 09:14:16,728: A backend was passed in as the mode but a session context manager is open so this job will run inside this session/batch instead of in job mode.

Warning: extracted path is incomplete (may be due to QAOA approximation). 
Extracted local path: [0, 3]
QAOA didn't give a clean Hamiltonian cycle; selected patients: [1, 2, 3]
Using brute-force best permutation among selected patients: (1, 2, 3) cost: 34.661
Trip A distance (evaluated): 34.661000, Trip B distance: 25.740000, Total: 60.401000
>> New best solution recorded.
