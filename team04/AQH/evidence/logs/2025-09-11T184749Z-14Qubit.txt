Trip 1 slack (binary decoded): 1
Trip 2 slack (binary decoded): 0

Patient assignments:
Trip 1: ['R2', 'R3_2'] (Capacity used: 2/3, Slack: 1)
  Constraint check: 2 + 1 = 3 (should be 3)
Trip 2: ['DT', 'GR', 'IT'] (Capacity used: 3/3, Slack: 0)
  Constraint check: 3 + 0 = 3 (should be 3)
Trip 1 optimal route: H -> R3_2 -> R2 -> H, Distance: 26.7879 km
Trip 2 optimal route: H -> DT -> GR -> IT -> H, Distance: 30.7365 km

Total distance: 57.5244 km

Constraint satisfaction check:
Patient DT assigned to 1 trips: OK
Patient GR assigned to 1 trips: OK
Patient R2 assigned to 1 trips: OK
Patient R3_2 assigned to 1 trips: OK
Patient IT assigned to 1 trips: OK
Trip 1: 2 patients + 1 slack = 3: OK
Trip 2: 3 patients + 0 slack = 3: OK

All constraints satisfied: True
