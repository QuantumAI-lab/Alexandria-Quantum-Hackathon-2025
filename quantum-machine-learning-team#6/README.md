# Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Classification Repository  
*A Comparative Study of Classical and Fully-Quantum Machine Learning Models*

---

## ðŸ“– Abstract
Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by progressive dopamine neuron loss, leading to motor and speech impairments.  
This repository provides a **scientific and reproducible framework** for comparing **classical ML models** and a **fully quantum variational classifier** using the [UCI Parkinsonâ€™s dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/470/parkinson+s+disease+classification).

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix
* Quantum-specific: **circuit depth**, **number of qubits**, **parameters**
* Final inference on **real QPU hardware**
