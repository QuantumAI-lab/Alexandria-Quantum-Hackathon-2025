## üî¨ Problem Statement: Quantifying $\text{CO}_2$ Capture

**Problem 3:** Environmental chemistry; carbon capturing process

Carbon capturing processes are crucial for mitigating climate change. Understanding the **molecular vibrational properties** is essential for determining reaction kinetics.

### Solution Goal:
Use a **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** or a similar quantum algorithm to quantify molecular vibrational energies and reaction pathways between $\text{CO}_2$ and a simplified amine-based solvent model, **$\text{NH}_3$**.

### Execution Requirement:
The solution must be executed on **real quantum hardware** using **IBM Quantum cloud resources**.

## üì¶ Deliverables and Project Structure

The project is divided into three primary deliverables, available in this repository:

1.  **Classical Model Notebook**
2.  **Quantum Model Notebook**
3.  **Technical Report** (Methodology Summary)

### 1. Classical Model Notebook (`classical_model.ipynb`)

This notebook demonstrates the conventional quantum chemistry approach to the problem.

* **Objective:** Analyze molecular geometries, vibrational modes, and reaction energetics for the $\text{CO}_2$ + $\text{NH}_3$ system, often focusing on the carbamic acid intermediate ($\text{NH}_2\text{COOH}$).
* **Key Tools:** **PySCF** (for SCF and CCSD calculations), **ASE**, **geomeTRIC**.
* **Calculations Included:** Geometry optimization, calculation of electronic and zero-point energy (ZPE) corrected reaction energies.

### 2. Quantum Model Notebook (`quantum_model.ipynb`)

This notebook implements the quantum algorithm to simulate the molecular properties.

* **Objective:** Apply a variational algorithm to find the ground state energy of the molecular system.
* **Key Tools:** **Qiskit**, **IBM Quantum Runtime**, **PySCF**, **ffsim**.
* **Methodology:**
    * **Hamiltonian Construction** using PySCF to generate fermionic operators.
    * **Ansatz Design:** Employing the **Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles (UCCSD)** ansatz, often using a spin-balanced form (e.g., `UCJOpSpinBalanced`).
    * **Execution:** Circuit design and submission for execution on **IBM Quantum backends**.

### 3. Technical Report

A comprehensive document outlining the methodology and results.

* **Content:**
    * Conceptual overview of the modeling approach.
    * Summary of tools and frameworks used (Qiskit, PySCF, etc.).
    * Evaluation metrics (e.g., **circuit depth**, **qubit count**, and **energy accuracy**).
    * Comparative analysis of simulation results (Classical vs. Quantum).
    * Discussion of limitations and **noise effects** observed during quantum hardware execution.
