## üß™ Problem Statement: $\text{CO}_2$ Capture Kinetics

The project addresses the critical environmental issue of carbon capture. Our goal is to analyze the molecular vibrational properties necessary for understanding the reaction kinetics between **Carbon Dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$)** and a simplified amine-based solvent model, **Ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$)**.

### Goal:
To use a **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** or similar quantum algorithm to quantify molecular vibrational energies and reaction pathways.

### Execution Platform:
The quantum solution is designed for and executed on **real quantum hardware** via the **IBM Quantum Cloud** resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack and Deliverables

The project deliverables are structured around two main models and a final report.

### 1. Classical Model Notebook (`classical_model.ipynb`)

This notebook performs traditional *ab initio* calculations to provide ground-truth data and initial parameters.

* **Objective:** Analyze molecular geometries (e.g., $\text{CO}_2$, $\text{NH}_3$, $\text{NH}_2\text{COOH}$), vibrational modes, and reaction energetics.
* **Key Tools:**
    * **PySCF:** Core engine for SCF (RHF) and correlation energy calculations (CCSD).
    * **ASE, geomeTRIC:** Used for geometry optimization and path finding simulations.
* **Key Findings (Snippets):** Includes plotting the potential energy surface for the $\text{NH}_3‚Äì\text{CO}_2$ complex and calculating the $\Delta E_{\text{ZPE}}$ corrected reaction energy.

### 2. Quantum Model Notebook (`quantum_model.ipynb`)

This notebook translates the chemical problem into a quantum mechanical simulation.

* **Objective:** Apply a variational quantum algorithm to determine the ground state energy of the molecular system.
* **Key Tools:**
    * **Qiskit / Qiskit IBM Runtime:** Framework for circuit design and execution on IBM quantum backends.
    * **ffsim:** Used to facilitate the encoding of molecular Hamiltonians and operators.
* **Methodology:**
    * **Hamiltonian Mapping:** Encoding the molecular system (e.g., $\text{CO}_2$ orbitals) into qubits.
    * **Ansatz:** Implementation of the **Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD)** algorithm, potentially using specialized operators like `UCJOpSpinBalanced`.
    * **Metrics:** Focused on resource evaluation (e.g., $\text{CO}_2$ simulation requiring **26 qubits**).

### 3. Technical Report

The definitive document for the project. It synthesizes the work from both notebooks.

* **Content Focus:** Methodology, summary of tools, quantitative evaluation metrics (qubit count, circuit depth), comparative analysis of classical vs. quantum results, and a discussion of hardware limitations and noise effects.
